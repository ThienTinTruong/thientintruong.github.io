I"t<p>Hello, thanks for dropping by. I’m a life-long fan of tennis and I want to get into data analytics so I thought, why not combine to the two together to create some fun projects for myself? In this first blog post I’d like to take another look at aces stats in tennis.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, in tennis, an ace is a serve that successfully lands in the service box and does not touch the receiving player’s racquet.</p>

<p>In tennis, the three all-time leader of aces served is John Isner, Ivo Karlovic, and Roger Federer. As of this writing, they have 13,813; 13,728; and 11,478 aces, respectively. But I’m not here to talk about them. Their data can easily by found on the <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/stats/aces">ATP website</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, I want to talk about who got aced on the most in the open era. I don’t believe this question has been asked before. It’s something I’ve been pondering about for a while so it’s about time I dig into the data to find out.</p>

<p>Caveat: the data set I get is from <a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp">Jeff Sackman’s repository</a>. I am not sure how accurate or complete it is. When I crunch the data, I find there is some discrepancy between my result and the official ATP website. For example, my result shows <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YlQAnsyW7_jmyOYFSk1WJ6O6_7u2PxgEgqcNLFfsgFY/edit#gid=262157908">John Isner has 13,936 aces</a> vs the <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/john-isner/i186/player-stats">ATP’s 13,814</a> aces so take what you read below with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>So let’s get right into it. Here are the stats for the top 10 men for getting aced on count (can’t think of a better term),match count,  and average aced on per match. All players must have at least 100 matches.</p>

<p>Just looking at the raw numbers of getting aced on I’m surprised that Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic are all in the top 10. But considering how many matches they’ve all played the average number of them getting aced on is not bad.</p>

<p>Here is another look at the top 10 highest average for getting aced on per match.</p>

<p>What’s surprising here is the biggest servers are not necessarily the worst returners. We have the journeyman Denis Kudla leading the pack with getting aced on 10 times per match followed my the almighty meme lord Tomic. What’s really surprising (to me) is Francis Tiafoe being third on the list.</p>

<p>EXTRA:</p>

<p>I want to explain my work flow and my thought process so you can see how I got there. First, I download and unzip the entire ATP data set FROM Jeff’s repository. Then I load all the ATP matches from 1968 to the present into <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">DB Browser for SQLite</a>. What I got is essentially one big data table for me to play with in SQLite. Each row details an individual match, winner name, loser name, and a host of other categories. It has the following columns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>tourney_id,	tourney_name,	surface,	draw_size,	tourney_level,	tourney_date,	match_num,	winner_id,	winner_seed,	winner_entry,	winner_name,	winner_hand,	winner_ht,	winner_ioc,	winner_age,	loser_id,	loser_seed,	loser_entry,	loser_name,	loser_hand,	loser_ht,	loser_ioc,	loser_age,	score,	best_of,	round,	minutes,	w_ace,	w_df,	w_svpt,	w_1stIn,	w_1stWon,	w_2ndWon,	w_SvGms,	w_bpSaved,	w_bpFaced,	l_ace,	l_df,	l_svpt,	l_1stIn,	l_1stWon,	l_2ndWon,	l_SvGms,	l_bpSaved,	l_bpFaced,	winner_rank,	winner_rank_points,	loser_rank,	loser_rank_points</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that there are two columns for ace stats. One is w_ace (winning player’s ace) and the other is l_ace (losing player’s ace). To get all the aces for a player, I’d have to add up all the aces in all the matches that he plays. This means adding up all the aces in all the matches he won and lost. Then add up all the matches he plays. Then divide the aces against the players by the matches to get the average. And finally apply the query to players to who have at least 100 matches under their belt and exclude rows with NULL values. The final SQL query would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT player_name, SUM(aces_against), SUM(matches) AS matches,  SUM(aces_against)*1.0/matches AS average_aces_against
FROM
(SELECT winner_name AS player_name, SUM(w_ace) AS aces_against, COUNT(winner_name) AS matches
FROM atp_matches
GROUP BY winner_name
UNION ALL
SELECT loser_name AS player_name, SUM(l_ace) AS aces_against, COUNT(loser_name) AS matches
FROM atp_matches
GROUP BY loser_name)
WHERE matches &gt;= 100
AND player_name IS NOT NULL 
AND matches IS NOT NULL 
AND got_aced IS NOT NULL 
AND aces IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY player_name
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YlQAnsyW7_jmyOYFSk1WJ6O6_7u2PxgEgqcNLFfsgFY/edit#gid=262157908">result</a>.</p>
