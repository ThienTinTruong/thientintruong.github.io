I"<p>I try to post once a week but juggling a full time job, watching a toddler, and doing chores around the house, it’s tough to find spare time to do this (unless I give up sleep). Anyway, enough of my complaints. For this entry, I’m doing some simple analysis of the Holy Trinity of men’s tennis. I just watched some Youtube videos on how to make a Talbeau dashboard so I’m putting what I learned into practice.</p>

<p>Again, the data is from <a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp">Jeff Sackman’s repository</a>. The SQL query for this is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT *
FROM atp_matches
WHERE winner_name  IN ('Roger Federer', 'Rafael Nadal', 'Novak Djokovic') 
OR loser_name IN ('Roger Federer','Rafael Nadal', 'Novak Djokovic')
</code></pre>
