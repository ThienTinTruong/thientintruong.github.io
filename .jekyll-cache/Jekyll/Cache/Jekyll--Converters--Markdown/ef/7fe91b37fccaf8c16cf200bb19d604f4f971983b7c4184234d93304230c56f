I"©<p>I try to post once a week but juggling a full time job, watching a toddler, and doing chores around the house, itâ€™s tough to find spare time to do this (unless I give up sleep). Anyway, enough of my complaints. For this entry, Iâ€™m doing some simple analysis of the Holy Trinity of menâ€™s tennis. I just watched some Youtube videos on how to make a Talbeau dashboard so Iâ€™m putting what I learned into practice.</p>
