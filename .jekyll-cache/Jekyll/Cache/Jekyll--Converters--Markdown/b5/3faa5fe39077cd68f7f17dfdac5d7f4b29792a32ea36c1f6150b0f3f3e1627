I"ç<p>I try to post once a week but juggling a full time job, watching a toddler, and doing chores around the house, itâ€™s tough to find spare time to do this (unless I give up sleep). Anyway, enough of my complaints. For this entry, Iâ€™m doing some simple analysis of the Holy Trinity of menâ€™s tennis. I just watched some Youtube videos on how to make a Talbeau dashboard so Iâ€™m putting what I learned into practice.</p>

<p>Again, the data is from <a href="https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp">Jeff Sackmanâ€™s repository</a>. The SQL query for this is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT *
FROM atp_matches
WHERE winner_name  IN ('Roger Federer', 'Rafael Nadal', 'Novak Djokovic') 
OR loser_name IN ('Roger Federer','Rafael Nadal', 'Novak Djokovic')
</code></pre>

<p>One of the advice in the videos is to keep it simple, so Iâ€™m starting out with just four visualization for now. As I learn more and get better I will update this to make it look more â€˜professionalâ€™.</p>
